# Scenic Spot management system

This is the project of class Data structure. Developed in Nov, 2018.

Used stack, queue, linkedlist, graph to develop the scenic spot management system. Users can use the system to search for the map of the spot, find the shortest path, find the hottest place, search for empty parking lot. The manager can used it to maintain the scenicc spot. 

In this project, I implemented some basic algorithm, including sorting, Dijkstra, Floyed, Prim etc.
